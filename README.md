# Simple project used to practice Java.
Will contain the implementation of basic data structures
- [X] List
- [X] Stack
- [ ] Set
- [ ] Linked list
- [ ] Doubly linked list
- [ ] TreeS


## ArrayList
Data structure more flexible than an array, adds elements always as last element.
- add(Integer) add an new element on the end of the list.
- get(Integer) return the element of received index.
- contains(Integer) check if list contains received element.
- sort() sort list elements.
- remove(Integer) remove element of the received index.
[ ] removeFirst(Integer value) remove first occurrence of received value.
[ ] removeAll(Integer value) remove all occurrences of received value.


## Stack
Data structure which stack and unstack values, only iterating with top element.
- push(Integer) add element to the top
- pop() remove element from top
- isEmpty() check if stack is empty
- getTop() return element from  top of the stack

## Set
Data structure which keeps elements sorted, and don't permit duplicity.
- add(Integer) add new element
- get(Integer) get element from received index.
- getElement(Integer) get element received.
- contains(Integer) check if received element exist.
- size() return number of elements.
- remove(Integer) remove element from received index.
- removeElement(Integer) remove element received.
